		Many private water wells produce only 1 or 2 gallons of water per minute. 
One way to avoid running out of water with these low-yield wells is to use a holding tank.
 A family of 4 will use about 250 gallons of water per day. However,
  there is a “natural” water holding tank in the casing (i.e., the hole) of the well itself.
   The deeper the well, the more water that will be stored that can be pumped out for household use.
    But how much water will be available?
Write a program that allows the user to input the radius of the well casing in inches 
(a typical well will have a 3-inch radius) and the depth of the well in feet
 (assume water will fill this entire depth, although in practice that will not be true 
 since the static water level will generally be 50 feet or more below the ground surface).
  The program should output the number of gallons stored in the well casing. For your reference:
The volume of a cylinder is (the pie  was here, but the IDE cannot read it so use 3.14)
pie r2h(pie time radius times 2 times height) , where r is the radius and h is the height. 1 cubic foot = 7.48 gallons 
of water.
For example, a 300-foot well full of water with a radius of 3 inches for the casing holds about 
441 gallons of water—plenty for a family of 4 and no need to install a separate holding tank.

		System.out.println("Enter the radius of the well in inches");
		double RADIUS = keyboard.nextDouble(); 
		System.out.println("Enter the Height in feets");
		double HEIGHT = keyboard.nextDouble();
		double RADIUS_FEET = RADIUS/12;
		double VOLUME = Math.PI * RADIUS_FEET * RADIUS_FEET * HEIGHT; 
		double GALLONS = VOLUME * 7.48;
		System.out.print("The well can hold up to " + GALLONS + " Gallons");

The Harris-Benedict equation estimates the number of calories your body needs to maintain your weight 
if you do no exercise. This is called your basal metabolic rate, or BMR. Solution to Project 8 
The calories needed for a woman to maintain her weight is: 
BMR = 655 + (4.3 × weight in pounds) + (4.7 × height in inches) − (4.7× age in years) 
The calories needed for a man to maintain his weight is: 
BMR = 66 + (6.3 × weight in pounds) + (12.9 × height in inches) − (6.8 × age in years) 
A typical chocolate bar will contain around 230 calories. Write a program that allows
the user to input his or her weight in pounds, height in inches, and age in years. 
The program should then output the number of chocolate bars that should be consumed
to maintain one’s weight for both a woman and a man of the input weight, height, and age.
